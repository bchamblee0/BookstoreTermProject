# BookstoreTermProject
The system maintains information about books, subjects, supplier, and shipping carriers. The bookstore acquires the desired books from suppliers (e.g. Amazon.com), and ships the books by carrier services (e.g. UPS). The system also keeps track of orders, manages customers and employees.
